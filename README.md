## Exercise NÂ°9

0. Install all dependencies and the vuex dependency. Execute the program as it is and try to understand the full funcionality; and what are the purpouse of "inject" and "provide" properties. Also, how the custom events are used.

5. Remove `inject`from `TodoList.vue`. Use a getter for `todo` and `isUserLogged`. Write a commit to perform the `remove todo` functionality.
